Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… don’t let it crash your calculator!
EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. 
Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. 

It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!
